# iTunes Library Analysis
##This program helps you to get a better understanding of your iTunes Library. 
##Here are the steps to run this program in python:
1. Export your iTunes Library as a XML file (i.e. library.xml)
1. Place the code (analysis.py) in the same folder as your xml library file. 
2. Change line 7 fname = "replace with your file name" (include "")
3. Run the code
##It will generate three different lists:
1. Top 20 artists
2. Top 20 genres
3. Top 20 track duration
##It will generate four different graphs:
1. A bar graph of top five artists
2. A pie chart of top five genres
3. A histogram of all the track durations
4. A duration histogram of all the tracks under 20 minutes (I had a lot of outliers)
##Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions/comments
