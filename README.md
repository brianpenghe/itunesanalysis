# itunesanalysis
##This little program helps you get a sense of what music/videos/podcasts are in your iTunes Library. 
##Here are the steps to run this program in python:
1. Place the code (itunesanalysis) in the same folder as your xml library file. 
2. Change line 7 fname = "replace with your file name" (include "")
3. Run the code

##It will generate four different graphs:
1. A bar graph of your top five artists
2. A pie chart of your top genres
3. A histogram of the durations of the entire library
4. My library had a lot of outliers so I zoomed in to songs under 20 minutes and built another histogram

##Please feel free to let me know if there is anything I should change.
